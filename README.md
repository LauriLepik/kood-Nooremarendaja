# kood/Nooremarendaja Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my collection of projects developed during the **kood/Jõhvi kood/Nooremarendaja (kood/Junior Developer)** curriculum. This repository demonstrates my progression in learning core software engineering concepts, focusing on **Java**, **CLI application design**, and **System Architecture**.

## 📂 Projects

*(Projects are listed in reverse chronological order, starting with the most recent)*

### 1. [Green Day Bank (WIP)](./bankingApp/) 🏦

*A magical command-line banking system where investments only go up.*

- **Key Features**: Session management, `BigDecimal` precision, Interest logic, Investment Funds.
- **Tech Stack**: Java, OOP, Custom Exceptions.
- **Why it stands out**: Simulates complex "stateful" financial logic and session persistence in a CLI environment.

### 2. [Wordle Game](./koodWordle/) 🟩🟨⬜

*A robust command-line implementation of the popular word guessing game.*

- **Key Features**: ANSI color feedback, interactive CLI, multi-length word support, and persistent player statistics.
- **Tech Stack**: Java (OOP), Streams API (Lazy Loading), Custom Argument Parsing, CSV Persistence.
- **Why it stands out**: Handles complex string algorithms, uses memory-efficient file streaming, and delivers a rich visual experience in the terminal.

### 3. [Telemetry Service](./telemetry-service/) 📡

*A high-performance backend component for normalizing critical infrastructure telemetry.*

- **Key Features**: HPACK-style state compression, **Null-safe precision handling**, and library-free CSV parsing.
- **Tech Stack**: Java (Pure Logic), Systems Engineering, Data Optimization.
- **Why it stands out**: Solves a complex "bandwidth constraint" problem without libraries, demonstrating ability to write efficient, low-level system code.

### 4. [Notes CLI Tool](./notesApp/) 📝

*An efficient tool for managing personal notes and lists from the command line.*

- **Key Features**: Create/Edit/Delete/Reorder notes, dynamic collection switching, and defensive error handling.
- **Tech Stack**: Java NIO, Clean Architecture (separation of CLI/Logic/DB), File-based Database, Environment-aware Pathing.
- **Why it stands out**: Demonstrates solid understanding of CRUD operations, file I/O, and data integrity (handling deleted files mid-operation).

### 5. [Cypher Tool](./cypher/) 🔐

*A cryptographic utility for encrypting and decrypting messages.*

- **Key Features**: Supports ROT13, Atbash, and **Affine Cipher** (Linear Math). Robust input validation and interactive menu.
- **Tech Stack**: Java, String Algorithms, Modular Arithmetic, Group Collaboration.
- **Why it stands out**: Showcases complex algorithmic thinking (encryption/decryption logic) and the ability to implement specific functional requirements in a team setting.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills

- **Languages**: Java (JDK 17+)
- **Core Concepts**:
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Data Structures & Algorithms
  - File I/O & Persistence (Java NIO)
  - Defensive Programming & Error Handling
- **Tools**: Git, Bash, VS Code
- *Solved **65+ algorithmic challenges** during the **Java Sprint** (including platform-based tasks and these repository exercises) ranging from basic logic to complex recursion; highlights included in [`./algorithm-challenges`](./algorithm-challenges/).*

## 🎓 About the Curriculum

These projects were developed as part of **[kood/Nooremarendaja](https://kood.tech/kood-nooremarendaja/)**, a **free, EU-funded, 5-month intensive coding program** provided by **kood/Jõhvi**.

### About kood/Jõhvi 🏫

**kood/Jõhvi** is a novel coding school in Estonia that operates on a radical **"no teachers, no classes"** philosophy. Based on the international **01 Edu System**, the methodology emphasizes:

- **Self-Directed Learning**: Students progress at their own pace through a gamified curriculum.
- **Peer-to-Peer Collaboration**: All learning happens through group work, code reviews, and solving complex problems together (mimicking real-world engineering teams).
- **Practical Focus**: The curriculum is 100% hands-on coding, designed to build industry-ready skills in a short timeframe.

### The [kood/Nooremarendaja](https://kood.tech/kood-nooremarendaja/) Program 🎓

This **5-month intensive program** (funded by **[NextGenerationEU](https://kood.tech/meist/toetused/)**) is designed to rapidly upskill participants for Junior Developer roles. The curriculum is structured into four distinct modules:

1. **Java Sprint (3 Weeks)**: Intensive immersion in programming basics, setting up the development environment, and solving algorithmic challenges.
2. **Back-end Development (7 Weeks)**: Deep dive into server-side logic, database management, architecture design, and REST APIs.
3. **Front-end Development (3 Weeks)**: User interface development using JavaScript and DOM manipulation to create interactive web applications.
4. **Practical Project / Internship (8 Weeks)**: A capstone experience where all skills are applied to build a complete web application with real data and multiple user roles.

Beyond technical syntax, the program instills critical professional habits:

- **Real-World Simulation**: No artificial deadlines or exams; success depends on managing time and delivering working software against functional requirements.
- **Soft Skills**: The peer-learning model forces constant communication, conflict resolution, and feedback exchange (code reviews are mandatory).
